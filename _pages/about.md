> “When he sings ‘If I Can't Love Her,’ he brings down the house. His voice is chillingly deep, resonant, powerful, and melodious. You can hear the ‘wows!’ and ‘who is that?’ from the people in the audience. It was my high point in the show for sure.” -Christine Swerczek

> “Timothy Vallier makes a triumphant debut at the Playhouse with his interpretation of the Beast.  Vallier has a phenomenally well-modulated voice, capable of a wide range of nuances ranging from animalistic snorting to cold anger to desperate loneliness to tender love.  He excellently executes Beast’s transformation from his temperamental, arrogant old self to his emergence as a kind and loving man.  Vallier also has a honey-sweet tenor which is well utilized in “If I Can’t Love Her” and “How Long Must This Go On?” -Chris Elston
